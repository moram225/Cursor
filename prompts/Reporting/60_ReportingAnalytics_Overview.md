**Core Feature:** Reporting and Analytics

**Purpose:** This feature provides reporting and analytics capabilities for the Veterinary PMS. It will leverage the data collected across various features (Patient Management, Appointments, Billing, Inventory, etc.) to generate reports and dashboards that provide insights into clinic performance, patient demographics, financial status, and operational efficiency.  This feature is essential for clinic administrators and owners to make informed decisions and optimize clinic operations.

**User Stories:**

*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to **view a dashboard summarizing key clinic metrics** such as daily/weekly/monthly revenue, appointment statistics, and patient visit trends.
*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to **generate financial reports** including revenue reports, expense reports, and profit and loss statements for specific periods.
*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to **generate patient demographic reports** to understand our client base (e.g., types of animals, age distribution, geographic distribution).
*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to **generate service utilization reports** to see which services are most frequently used and generate the most revenue.
*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to **generate product sales reports** to track product performance and identify best-selling items.
*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to **generate staff performance reports** (e.g., number of appointments handled, visits conducted) to evaluate staff workload and productivity.
*   As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to be able to **export reports** in common formats (e.g., CSV, PDF) for further analysis or sharing.
*   *(Future Enhancement)* As a **Clinic Administrator**, I want to be able to **customize reports** and dashboards to focus on specific metrics relevant to my needs.

**Key Functionalities:**

*   **Dashboard:**
    *   Display key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance (revenue, appointments, visits, new clients/patients).
    *   Visualize data using charts and graphs (e.g., revenue trends, appointment distribution, patient type breakdown).
    *   Allow users to select date ranges for dashboard data.

*   **Financial Reports:**
    *   Revenue reports: Total revenue, revenue by service category, revenue by product category, revenue by staff member, revenue by location, revenue trends over time.
    *   Expense reports: Total expenses, expenses by category, expense trends over time.
    *   Profit & Loss statements:  Revenue vs. Expenses for a given period, calculating profit/loss.
    *   Payment reports: Summary of payments received, payment method analysis.

*   **Operational Reports:**
    *   Appointment reports: Appointment volume, appointment type distribution, appointment status analysis (show rates, cancellation rates).
    *   Patient visit reports: Visit frequency, reason for visit analysis, common diagnoses, average visit duration.
    *   Staff performance reports: Appointments/visits per staff member, revenue generated per staff member.
    *   Inventory reports (already partially covered in Inventory Management, but reporting can be centralized here or linked): Stock levels, stock valuation, stock transaction history, product sales performance.

*   **Patient & Client Reports:**
    *   Patient demographic reports: Animal type distribution, breed distribution, age distribution, gender distribution.
    *   Client demographic reports: Client location distribution (by city, state), new client acquisition trends.

**Database Tables (Relevant Entities):**

*   **All Fact Tables**: `FactPatientVisits`, `FactInvoiceLines`, `FactPayments`, `FactExpenses`, `FactStockTransactions`, `FactOrderLines` (source data for reports).
*   **All Dimension Tables**: `DimClients`, `DimPatients`, `DimStaff`, `DimProducts`, `DimServices`, `DimSuppliers`, `DimExpenseCategories`, `DimPaymentMethods`, `DimLocations` (context for reporting).
*   **Appointments**: For appointment-related reports.
*   **Invoices**: For financial reports.

**Instructions for AI Agent:**

*   Based on this overview and the database schema defined in all `10_Database_Schema_*.md` files, proceed to create the Backend API definitions in `62_ReportingAnalytics_Backend_API.md`.
*   Focus on creating API endpoints for retrieving various reports as outlined above (financial, operational, patient/client reports). Start with a basic set of reports (e.g., revenue report, appointment report, patient demographics).
*   Ensure API endpoints are designed for efficient data retrieval and aggregation. Consider query parameters for date ranges, filters, and grouping.
*   Ensure API design follows RESTful principles, uses appropriate HTTP methods and status codes, and includes authentication.
*   After defining the API, generate the corresponding NestJS backend services in `63_ReportingAnalytics_Backend_Services.md`. These services will contain the core logic for data aggregation and report generation using Prisma ORM and potentially database raw queries or specialized aggregation libraries if needed for complex reports.
