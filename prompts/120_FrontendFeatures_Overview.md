# 120_FrontendFeatures_Overview.md

**Core Area:** Frontend Features

**Purpose:**

This section outlines the planned frontend features for the Veterinary PMS application.  We will be building user interfaces using Next.js and a combination of UI libraries (Joy UI Templates, MUI Core, Shadcn UI) to create a functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing application for veterinary clinic staff and potentially clients in the future.

**Feature Groups (Initial Focus):**

We will initially focus on building frontend interfaces for these key areas:

1.  **Authentication:**
    *   Login Page
    *   Registration Page (for new users - initially for clinic staff)
    *   Forgot Password / Password Reset

2.  **User Profile Management:**
    *   View User Profile
    *   Edit User Profile
    *   Change Password

3.  **Clinic Administrator Dashboard:**
    *   Overview Dashboard Page (initially displaying placeholder data, will be connected to Reporting & Analytics backend later)

*   **API Key Management Frontend:**
    *   API Key Generation and Management UI (for Tenant Admin/Root users)

**File Organization for Frontend Features (Example for Authentication):**

For each frontend feature (like Authentication), we will typically have these files:

*   `[FeatureArea]/[FeatureName]_Frontend_Overview.md` (e.g., `Authentication/130_Authentication_Frontend_Overview.md`) - Overview of the frontend feature, components, pages, data flow.
*   `[FeatureArea]/[FeatureName]_Frontend_Components.md` (e.g., `Authentication/132_Authentication_Frontend_Components.md`) - Definition of React components for the feature (forms, buttons, UI elements).
*   `[FeatureArea]/[FeatureName]_Frontend_Pages.md` (e.g., `Authentication/133_Authentication_Frontend_Pages.md`) - Definition of Next.js pages for the feature (layout, routing, data fetching, component composition).

**Instructions for AI Agent:**

*   This file provides an overview of the planned frontend features and their organization.
*   The next step is to update `00_Setup_Control_Center.md` to include the `07_Frontend_Setup_UI_Libraries.md` and this `120_FrontendFeatures_Overview.md` file in the execution plan.
*   After updating `00_Setup_Control_Center.md`, the AI agent should execute `00_Setup_Control_Center.md` to proceed with setting up the UI libraries.
